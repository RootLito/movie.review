            <small>December 14, 2007</small>
            <p>
                I like this movie a lot that makes me watch it over and over again. It is more like a covid but the virus is way more dangerous which will turn you into a mutant(Dark seeker) if ever you'll get infected. A brilliant scientist named Robert Neville has survived a man-made plague that turns people into vicious mutants. With the help of his own immune blood, he searches for more potential survivors as he wanders around New York City alone. While the infected wait for Neville to make a mistake that will lead to his capture, Neville is aware of how outnumbered he is and how the odds are against him. This movie is absolutely amazing, go and check it out.

                          Demon hunter John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a suicide survivor, has traveled to hell and back. He is aware that, unless he can accumulate enough good deeds to ascend God's ladder to heaven, he will travel to Satan's realm after death. Constantine is entangled in a paranormal conspiracy involving both demonic and angelic forces while assisting policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) in looking into her identical twin's apparent suicide.

                          Without a ship or crew, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean. The town is under attack from a pirate ship later that evening, so his timing is unfortunate. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter, is taken hostage by the pirates because she is in possession of a priceless coin that is connected to a curse that has turned the pirates into the undead. Orlando Bloom, a brave blacksmith who is in love with Elizabeth, joins forces with Sparrow to pursue the pirates.

Hobbs requests assistance from Dom and his team in exchange for everyone's complete pardons because he is unable to take them down on his own.

                <p>Here are some of my <strong>favorite</strong> anime</p>
                <p>Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term for cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan, distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance, and supernatural forces.Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. </p>

                    <p>
                      Both the father and mother of the Elric brothers have long since deserted them. They decide to undertake an illegal human transmutation in an attempt to bring their mother back, but they lose their bodies in the process. With his only objective being to return his brother to his former state, Edward must now enlist in the military in order to obtain specific alchemical powers. But with conflict looming, it's only a matter of time before they are both compelled to consider their principles and, in the end, make a decision regarding the worth of human life.

                    <p>Tanjiro Kamado's family was murdered by demons, and his lone surviving sibling, Nezuko, was changed into a demon. He swears to change her back into a human. Although it's fair to argue that Demon Slayer's plot is quite simple, this is actually the show's strongest point. The rules and stakes of the narrative were defined early and remained intact for the duration of the manga, which ended in May 2020, therefore Demon Slayer has never been particularly interested in world-building.</p>

              A cartoon makes a brief, funny comment using illustrations and is often found on television, in a newspaper or in a magazine. The Simpsons and Snoopy? Both cartoons.A cartoon can be a satirical or humorous drawing, a series of illustrations (also called a comic strip), or an animated film. Many kids grow up watching new and classic cartoons on TV. </p>
